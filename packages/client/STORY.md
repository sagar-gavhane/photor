# Collaborative Graphics Design Platform

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to build a simple online image editing tool with basic functionalities and simple real time collaboration using webrtc

## Description

Candidate needs to build a very simple image editing tool using canvas that lets user add multiple images / text as well as let multiple people check the design in real time.

## Features

- A panel that loads thumbnails from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/v2/list).

- A blank canvas (toggle between 16/9 and 9/16)

- Click and add multiple images from left panel

- Ability to real time collaborate on the design ie let other user check in real time what the author is doing on a particular design

## Bonus Features

- Load the app on a unique url which can be shred

- Explore potential of allowing both the users to edit the design at the same time.

- Drag and drop images on the canvas.

## Deliverables

This is a fairly challenging task, so we are not expecting a full fledged solution. Rather our expectations are a working solution that can execute the above mentioned features. We would love if you can document your assumptions, the features that it supports and some thoughts on what are the major challenges to develop a full fledge solution and how you think you will approach it.

- A typescript project that runs the app on localhost. The requirement for this task is to implement the central canvas / editing area using the canvas api.

- Readme file to let us know how to run the app and any other documentation that you might want to share

## Instructions

- One of the key challenges of this assignment is identifying how to work with canvas api and webrtc. You are allowed to use any libraries.

- Deploy the project on heroku/vercel/s3/netlify.

- A well written code with good abstractions will definitely make the project more appealing

- Good Design / UI is not important but definitely has bonus points

- This will be followed by an interview where you will be asked to explain your decisions and asked to describe about challenges and opportunities with your solution

- Please ask questions. Its ok to have doubts and we are eager to answer those.

- Most importantly, have fun building it :) :)
